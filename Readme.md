# MCP Documentation

### Before we start i recomment using <a href="https://github.com/MixV2/EpicResearch">EpicResearch</a> by MixV2

#### This Docs were made for the development of Lunar's Backend and were created by not_secret1337.
#### Also these docs are far from good so as I said earlier use Epic Research by MixV2 for your Backend.
